	* We need to write a Java class, namely Q12Time.java, which computes 
	* the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand on a traditional 
	* analogue clock. The angles are measured counterclockwise from hour 
	* to minute hand. The results are rounded and normalised so that 
	* it is between 0 and 359 (inclusively). 
	* The program is tested with the following times: 9:00, 3:00, 18:00, 
	* 1:00, 2:30, and 4:41 (with results 270 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 
	* 30 degrees, 255 degrees, and 254 degrees).
